    	<h1>Who Am I <i>?</i></h1>
    	<p style="width: 80%;">That's the question, isn't it? In a profession such as this, secrets are not uncommon (you should know this!). My name will remain a mystery to you, dear customer, but you may call me the <b>Potion Master</b>! </p>
		
		<p style="width: 80%;">I founded the Salem Apothecary to provide those will less expertise, time and care than I who need potions for any variety of reasons! Past customers have told me that appreciate my policy of never asking what they intend to use the potion for; after all, it isn't <i>any</i> of my business and I like to keep it that way! All I ask in return is you promote my little magic shop to your friends and deny its existance to anyone who might not understand us! </p>
		
				<img src="images/mana_potion.png" style="float:right;margin-right: -10%;padding-bottom:20px;max-width: 150px;" alt="mana potion">
				
		<p style="width: 80%;">Most prices are negotiable and I'm always up for a good trade if you have something better to offer than money! However, <b>all sales are final and no refunds will be given</b>! I can't take back a used potion, now can I? Once the potion has been delivered to you (by my personal couriers, of course!), it can't be returned to me. Why? Well! I don't know what you might've done to it, and <i>any</i> slight alteration could have any number of results, thus making the potion useless to all who desire a specific outcome!</p>
		
		<p style="width: 80%;">All my listings are pre-made, but I often get asked if I make custom potions on a case-by-case basis. The answer is <b>yes</b>! Contact me directly and we'll discuss what you're looking for!</p>
